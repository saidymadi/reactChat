assuming you have node installed 

in this same directory 

npm install 

npm run build

then npm start 

in your browser navigate to localhost:3000


in the chat text area I allowed a backdoor shortcut 
you can type in 

kill-server-please 

which will cause an exception and take down the express server down

you will be notified at the client side with an alert

but then you can still continue adding users/typing  as long as you do not refresh 
(I did not do manifest/local host html5 offline mode)

and when you do npm start again all the chat items will be quered and inserted in place :) 


---------
you can launch multiple browser . been tested on edge IE11 latest Chrome and Firefox browsers
